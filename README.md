# rstoolsA10

 **`rstoolsA10`is the source code of  [*meta-rstools*](https://github.com/robseb/meta-rstools).**

`meta-rstools` is a Layer for the Yocto project to add a simple way for fully accessing the FPGA Manager of the Intel (ALTERA) Arria 10 SoC-FPGA (SoCFPGA).

With a single command it is possible to change FPGA configuration or to read and write the *ARM AXI-Bridge* to the FPGA fabric. 
The layer is a part of [*rsYocto*](https://github.com/robseb/rsyocto).

`Note: The Writing FPGA Fabric Feature is under development!`

*rstoolsA10* and *rsyocto* are a self-developed projects in which no other companies are involved. 
It is specifically designed to serve students and the Linux/FPGA open-source community with its publication on GitHub and its open-source MIT license. 
In the future, *rsyocto* will retain its open-source status and it will be further developed. 

Due to the enthusiasm of commercial users, special features for industrial, scientific and automotive applications 
were developed and ready for the implementation in a highly optimazed closed commercial version. 
Partnerships as an embedded SoC-FPGA design service to fulfil these specific commercial requirements are offered. 
It should help, besides students with the *rsyocto* open-source version, commercial users, as well.
